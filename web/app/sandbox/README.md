# Why?

I want to build the best UX/UI for web3 to be as accessible as ever. I'm using
this "sandbox" folder as a playground to practice frontend and fullstack web3
dev. Then should port it to the core Equilibrio codebase.

I believe accessibility is a key missing piece for adoption, since even for the
most technical users often it's still non-trivial to use blockchain products or
follow the best security and privacy practices. It's so easy to get lost and
interfaces have a crucial leverage on preventing that.

Till my mom and dad can use blockchain in a daily basis, securely, without even
noticing they're using blockchain nor worrying about technical aspects, I'm not
done. The account and chain abstraction should be so robust it's a no-brainer
for anyone to use it.

This Equilibrio project also touches a critical aspect: B2B adoption. From the
SMBs to the Enterprise. It should be ridiculously accessible for them,
especially regarding the stablecoin transactions, which have proven to be a
"no-coiner-friendly" use case and has improved accessibility on receiving
payments specially for emerging markets. Stripe is so popular for a reason, and
this aims to become "the Stripe of web3", starting with LatAm.

[Hackatomik](https://github.com/hackatomik) is also contributing to enhance web3
developer adoption in our region, and having a full-fledged open source protocol
like this can greatly incentivize hands-on practice for newcomers, nurtured
within our own community.
